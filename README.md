# PreTraining_MoCo
We pre-train MoCo_v3 on Million Aid Dataset.
MoCoV3 Pretraining on MillionAID ðŸ“Š
Project Overview
This project involves pretraining a MoCoV3 model with the MillionAID dataset to capture rich, high-level representations from satellite imagery. With nearly a million unlabeled images, this dataset provides a robust foundation for self-supervised learning. We specifically focused on ViT-Base-16 as the backbone for our pretraining, followed by a linear probe evaluation to assess the quality of representations learned during pretraining.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset and Pretraining Setup
Dataset: We used a subset of 150,000 randomly selected images from MillionAID, ensuring unbiased selection due to the lack of labels.
Objective: Pretrain MoCoV3 on unlabeled data, enabling the model to learn feature-rich representations without explicit labels.
Backbone: The ViT-Base-16 transformer model, a powerful choice for image representation learning, was employed as the backbone for our MoCoV3 setup.
Pretraining Process Highlights:
Unlabeled Learning: MoCoV3 learns representations via contrastive learning, optimizing for similarity among positive pairs and dissimilarity among negative pairs.
Computational Efficiency: Despite the large dataset, our subset and ViT backbone allowed us to maintain feasible training times while capturing effective representations.
Evaluation: Assessing Pretraining Quality
After pretraining, we evaluated the quality of the learned representations with a linear probe on a labeled subset of MillionAID. The evaluation process is simple yet effective:

Frozen Weights: The pretrained weights are frozen, keeping them intact for evaluation.
Linear Classifier: We added a lightweight linear layer to probe the modelâ€™s representation quality on classification tasks.
Evaluation Metrics: Key metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall were used to quantify the quality of the learned representations.
